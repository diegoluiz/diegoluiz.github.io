If by any change you landed in this blog because of [this](https://diegoluiz.com/2016/06/15/298/) or [this](https://diegoluiz.com/2015/09/17/starting-using-git-references/) article.

I would recommend you to read [this article](http://megakemp.com/2014/08/14/the-importance-of-a-good-looking-history/) as well.

I landed in that blog because of [this post](http://megakemp.com/2016/06/20/on-being-a-good-dotnet-developer/) which is worthy reading as well.

Unfortunately the guy is not posting for frequently, however I run all throughout all post until the first one :)
